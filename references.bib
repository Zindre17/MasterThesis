Abstract = {Although verbal learning offers a powerful tool, Mayer explores ways of going beyond the purely verbal. Recent advances in graphics technology and information technology have prompted new efforts to understand the potential of multimedia learning as a means of promoting human understanding. In this second edition, Mayer includes double the number of experimental comparisons, 6 new principles - signalling, segmenting, pertaining, personalization, voice and image principles. The 12 principles of multimedia instructional design have been reorganized into three sections - reducing extraneous processing, managing essential processing and fostering generative processing. Finally an indication of the maturity of the field is that the second edition highlights boundary conditions for each principle research-based constraints on when a principle is likely or not likely to apply. The boundary conditions are interpreted in terms of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, and help to enrich },

@article{GameFlow,

abstract = {<p>Although player enjoyment is central to computer games, there is currently no accepted model of player enjoyment in games. There are many heuristics in the literature, based on elements such as the game interface, mechanics, gameplay, and narrative. However, there is a need to integrate these heuristics into a validated model that can be used to design, evaluate, and understand enjoyment in games. We have drawn together the various heuristics into a concise model of enjoyment in games that is structured by flow. Flow, a widely accepted model of enjoyment, includes eight elements that, we found, encompass the various heuristics from the literature. Our new model, GameFlow, consists of eight elements -- concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback, immersion, and social interaction. Each element includes a set of criteria for achieving enjoyment in games. An initial investigation and validation of the GameFlow model was carried out by conducting expert reviews of two real-time strategy games, one high-rating and one low-rating, using the GameFlow criteria. The result was a deeper understanding of enjoyment in real-time strategy games and the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the GameFlow model as an evaluation tool. The GameFlow criteria were able to successfully distinguish between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded and the other failed. We concluded that the GameFlow model can be used in its current form to review games; further work will provide tools for designing and evaluating enjoyment in games.</p>},

abstract = {Cognitive Load Theory   John Sweller, Paul Ayres, Slava Kalyuga     Effective instructional design depends on the close study of human cognitive architecture—the processes and structures that allow people to acquire and use knowledge. Without this background, we might recognize that a teaching strategy is successful, but have no understanding as to why it works, or how it might be improved.   Cognitive Load Theory offers a novel, evolutionary-based perspective on the cognitive architecture that informs instructional design. By conceptualizing biological evolution as an information processing system and relating it to human cognitive processes, cognitive load theory bypasses many core assumptions of traditional learning theories. Its focus on the aspects of human cognitive architecture that are relevant to learning and instruction (particularly regarding the functions of long-term and working memory) puts the emphasis on domain-specific rather than general learning, resulting in a clearer understanding of educational design and a basis for more effective instructional methods. Coverage includes:   The analogy between evolution by natural selection and human cognition. Categories of cognitive load and their interactions in learning. Strategies for measuring cognitive load. Cognitive load effects and how they lead to educational innovation. Instructional design principles resulting from cognitive load theory.   Academics, researchers, instructional designers, cognitive and educational psychologists, and students of cognition and education, especially those concerned with education technology, will look to Cognitive Load Theory as a vital addition to their libraries.  .},

@misc{KongOgKruke,
abstract = {Virtual reality has in recent years become exceedingly popular since devices of high enough quality have become available at an affordable price, starting with the Oculus Rift in 2016. This thesis explores how virtual reality can be used to teach complex concepts for educational purposes. Specifically, it explores how virtual reality can be used in the course TDT4120 - Algorithms and Data Structures at NTNU to teach students the algorithms presented in there. This was done by implementing a virtual reality application in the Unity game engine. The application tries to teach the students three different sorting algorithms - bubble sort, insertion sort and quicksort - by interacting with an array of boxes. Several helper functionalities were implemented as well, such as highlighting and color coding to assist the user, as well as instructional videos for each algorithm. Videos demonstrating the application can be found at https://tinyurl.com/VirtSort. The application was evaluated based on user testing, where it was tested by NTNU students, both with and without experience from the TDT4120 course. The testing revealed that the application still has some way to go before being a viable learning tool. This can to some degree be attributed to users being somewhat inexperienced with using VR and still requiring too much prior knowledge of the algorithms to use the application efficiently. Despite this, the results indicate that the problem is not with the concept itself, but rather the application missing some features. Overall, the conclusion leaves a positive impression of the usage of VR to teach algorithms, as well as other complex concepts.},
