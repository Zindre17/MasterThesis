\begin{abstract}
    Virtual Reality is an ``up and coming'' technology. Hardware became available to consumers in 2016, and several big companies are investing a lot to improve these technologies, as well as making them more affordable. The main focus of VR from the start has been immersive games, but there is belief that there are other areas where VR can be utilized as well. 
    
    This thesis wanted to experiment with using VR in a learning setting. To do this, an application was developed with the aim of helping to teach topics from different university courses to students. The course ``Algorithms and data structures'' was the course chosen for the prototype, as this is a course many struggle with. This application was developed in the Unity 3D game engine, and it was evaluated through performing user tests followed by a questionnaire. The results revealed nothing in regards to learning, but rather how usable the developed prototype was, and whether the participants believed in using this technology for learning. The usability was not great, but it was not particularly bad either, as it could with minor additions become a lot better. And yes, the participants believed this technology should be used in learning. Unanimously so. 
    
    The prototype is hosted publicly on \href{https://github.com/Zindre17/UniVRsity}{Github}\cite{Github} and is available for use, with or without modifications, by anyone interested in doing so. A video tour of the final prototype can be watched by following \href{https://youtu.be/VUHdUxoRH5Y}{this link}\cite{UniVRsity}.
