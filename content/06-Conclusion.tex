\section{Conclusion}

%We have reached the end. The project is finished, but what are we left with? Well, I will answer this in terms of the research questions. 
We have reached the end. This section will conclude this article as well as give suggestions for further work.

\subsection{Conclusion}
This project

\subsection{Future Work}
There is a lot of things that can be done to improve this prototype and there are a lot of thing that can be done to further evaluate it. A good place to start for the prototype would be to add sound and voice to it, as well as a tutorial for all the topics. This would increase its usability as well as make it more entertaining to use. Possibly improving the effectiveness of the teaching as well, should the theory be correct. Other parts of the prototype which could be worked more on is adding more content. More topics to the current course, or new courses and topics for them. 

For further evaluating the prototype, it could be interesting to see if it aids in the learning process. To do this one could team up with the one responsible for the course, and have some of the students taking the course use the prototype as a part of their course work. Then one could do a survey before the course started, or the specific topic evaluating for, to see how much knowledge the students had before starting. This would have to be done by both the students with the prototype included in their course work as well as those without it, such that the results can be measured against. There should also be two more surveys, one to check the knowledge and understanding right after the playing of the prototype or after the topic, to see what was learned in this period, and finally one at a later point to check for retained learning. Then compare the results of the group with the prototype in their course work against those with the normal course work, and see which group had higher learning. It would also be possible, and maybe even a good idea, to have three groups; normal course work, only prototype, and both.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Will the developed prototype indicate that using VR might be suited for teaching/learning?
    \item Does people think VR is suited in a school or learning setting?
    \item Is the new prototype improved compared to the previous version?
